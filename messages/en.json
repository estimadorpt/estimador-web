    "overviewDescription": "We've developed a statistical forecasting model for Portuguese elections that captures both long-term political trends and district-level dynamics. It represents an evolution of traditional election models, designed specifically to address the challenges of Portugal's multi-party, district-based electoral system.",
    "challengeDescription1": "Portugal's electoral landscape presents unique forecasting challenges. The country has multiple significant political parties ranging from the traditional center-left (PS) and center-right (AD) to newer entrants like the liberal IL and right-wing Chega. Elections are decided through a proportional representation system across multiple districts, with seats allocated using the D'Hondt method.",
    "challengeDescription2": "Traditional forecasting approaches struggle with several aspects of this system:",
    "validationDescription": "We continuously refine our model based on these validation exercises.",
    "limitationsDescription1": "Our model has several important limitations:",
    "limitationsDescription2": "We encourage users to interpret our forecasts as probabilistic estimates, not certainties."
