    "overviewDescription": "We've developed a Bayesian statistical model to forecast Portuguese presidential elections. The model combines polling data with candidate party affiliations, adjusting for pollster house effects and quantifying uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulations.",
    "challengeDescription1": "Portuguese presidential elections use a two-round system. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in the first round, the top two candidates proceed to a runoff. With multiple candidates and a significant percentage of undecided voters, forecasting outcomes requires carefully modeling uncertainty.",

    "challengeList2": "Candidates with varying levels of public recognition",
    "challengeList3": "Campaign dynamics that can shift rapidly",
    "challengeList4": "Potential vote transfer between rounds",
    "modelDescription": "Our approach uses a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the evolution of support for each candidate over time. This allows us to capture both smooth trends and sudden shifts while always quantifying uncertainty.",
