# Methodology

## Overview

We've developed a Bayesian statistical model to forecast Portuguese presidential elections. The model combines polling data with candidate party affiliations, adjusting for pollster house effects and quantifying uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulations.

## The Challenge of Forecasting Presidential Elections

Portuguese presidential elections use a two-round system. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in the first round, the top two candidates proceed to a runoff. With multiple candidates and a significant percentage of undecided voters, forecasting outcomes requires carefully modeling uncertainty.

Key challenges include:

- **High percentage of undecided voters** (~35%)
- **Candidates with varying levels of public recognition**
- **Campaign dynamics** that can shift rapidly
- **Potential vote transfer** between rounds

## The Bayesian Forecasting Model

Our approach uses a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the evolution of support for each candidate over time. This allows us to capture both smooth trends and sudden shifts while always quantifying uncertainty.

### Key Components

1. **Trend Estimation:** We model the underlying support for each candidate using polling data
2. **Pollster House Effects:** We account for systematic biases in different polling organizations
3. **Party Affiliation:** We incorporate priors based on the parties supporting each candidate
4. **Outcome Simulation:** We run thousands of simulations to calculate win probabilities

## Polling Analysis

We collect polling data from major Portuguese polling organizations and apply several corrections:

- **House Effects:** Each pollster has systematic tendencies to over- or under-estimate certain candidates
- **Sample Size Adjustments:** Larger polls receive more weight
- **Recency Weighting:** More recent polls have greater influence
- **Mode Effects:** We account for differences between online, telephone, and in-person polling

## Simulation Process

For each simulation, we generate vote shares for each candidate and check:

1. Whether any candidate reaches more than 50% in the first round
2. Which two candidates advance to the second round
3. Record the outcome of each simulation

We run thousands of these simulations to build probability distributions for outcomes.

## Uncertainty Quantification

Our model incorporates several sources of uncertainty:

- **Polling Error:** Historical polling accuracy in Portuguese elections
- **Campaign Effects:** Potential for late shifts in voter preference
- **Undecided Voters:** Significant uncertainty about how undecided voters will vote
- **Model Uncertainty:** Parameter estimation uncertainty

## Model Validation

We validate our approach through:

1. Backtesting on previous Portuguese presidential elections
2. Cross-validation using held-out polling data
3. Comparison with actual election results
4. Calibration tests to ensure our probabilities are well-calibrated

We continuously refine our model based on these validation exercises.

## Limitations and Caveats

Our model has several important limitations:

- Relies on polling data, which can be biased or unrepresentative
- May not capture unprecedented political developments
- Assumes historical patterns continue to hold
- Cannot predict the impact of major campaign events or scandals
- Difficulty predicting how undecided voters will behave

We encourage users to interpret our forecasts as probabilistic estimates, not certainties.
